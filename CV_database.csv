customers come and buy their refrigerators and products. Automate every flow of this project and report bugs in seconds. 

• 

•  Design framework using Cypress , Mocha for automating websites. Create my own custom commands for efficient testing. Use hooks, tags, 

• 

assertions, and everything else which is present in cypress mocha framework according to needs. 
For some websites also design Hybrid Testing Framework using Python, Selenium, Seleniumbase, Page Object Model, PyTest, Jenkins, Git. Also 
use Python Built in functions which provide extra functionality and features  for automating tests. 

•  Also integrate my framework with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to achieve some useful functionalities and features that is 

Visualization Testing in which our code just acts like a human eye and checks whether  the text or field is not overlapping, checks whether the 
size, shape, color, everything is according to the requirements or not and after that report bugs in seconds.
